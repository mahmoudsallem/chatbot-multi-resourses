Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Fantastic Four #19 (October 1963) as Rama-Tut, an adversary of the Fantastic Four, before being reinvented as Kang in The Avengers #8 (September 1964), an adversary of the Avengers. A time-traveler, several alternate versions of Kang have appeared throughout Marvel Comics titles over the years, such as Rama-Tut, Immortus, Scarlet Centurion, Victor Timely, Iron Lad, and Mister Gryphon.\\nKang the Conqueror has been described as one of Marvel's most notable and powerful villains. Kang has made media appearances in animated television and video games. Kang made his live-action debut in the MCU film Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023), portrayed by Jonathan Majors, who previously appeared as different versions of the character in the Disney+ series Loki (2021–2023).\\n\\n\""
